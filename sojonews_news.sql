However, when Agarwal tried to secure finances for $1.5 billion in loan and bond repayments, he hit a roadblock. The bondholders are driving the price of the August 2024 note below 70 cents on the dollar, and if the fundraising fails, the issuerâs credit rating could come under pressure.

But with the Fed giving no indication that itâs done raising rates and existing Vedanta Resources bonds dropping in value, he might struggle to raise fresh money at a reasonable cost. This presents a problem for the mining magnate, as the post-pandemic era of supernormal commodity profits could be over.</p><p>Seven years ago, Agarwalâs creditors were even more jittery than now. Back then, the zinc miner helped him out with a special dividend. New Delhi didnât mind the maneuver because at the time the firm had more than $5 billion in cash. Besides, as a minority shareholder, the finance ministry also got its share of the bounty. This time around, though, Agarwal seems to have overreached.</p><p>If Agarwal incurs the governmentâs displeasure in the process of forcing the asset sale, his ambition to partner with Taiwanâs Foxconn Technology Group for a $19 billion semiconductor factory might come under a cloud. Already, that project is being watched closely by opposition politicians in neighboring Maharashtra who have slammed its last-minute relocation to Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs home state of Gujarat. Besides, taxpayers will bear half the cost of chip-manufacturing units, and Indiaâs general elections are due next year. Influential voices, such as the University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan, a former central bank governor, have questioned Vedantaâs involvement, citing its lack of chipmaking competence.</p><p>Agarwalâs top priority should be to stay out of the headlines, with the Adani group facing allegations of stock-price manipulation and accounting fraud, putting the Modi administration under heightened scrutiny about entanglement of public purpose with private profit.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Read more at: <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/adani-isnt-the-only-indian-tycoon-in-trouble-andy-mukherjee/articleshow/98262044.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Economictimes.India</a></p>', 0, 0, 0, '', 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dkxsi7mmm/image/upload/v1677494645/jsq3dgdjmj6rhp4j3yc9.jpg', 'jsq3dgdjmj6rhp4j3yc9', 10, '[\"14-20\",\"21-35\",\"36-50\",\"51 & above\"]', '[\"Male\",\"Female\",\"Others\"]', '2023-02-27 10:44:05', '2023-04-15 07:48:24'),
